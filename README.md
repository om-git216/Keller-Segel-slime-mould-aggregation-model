# Keller-Segel-slime-mould-aggregation-model

This is the Keller Segel Slime mould aggregation model. 
Slime molds act as agents and interact with the environment made up of cAMP molecules. The concentration of cAMP is defined everywhere in space, and it changes by its own inherent dynamics (natural decay) and by the action of agents (secretion of cAMP molecules by agents). This model can be implemented as an agent based model (ABM).

The following represent the aggretion and simulation of the model over time.
